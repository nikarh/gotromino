Gotromino - a console Tetris™-like game written in go
===========================================

I don't remember writing a Tetris™ game during my programming career,
which is pretty weird. So here it goes.
Tetris™, golang, terminal UI. What could be better?

The game is not finished, so I hope opening it to public will 
stimulate me to complete it (as if it will, haha).

Things not implemented yet:

- [ ] End game logic
- [ ] Scores
- [ ] Levels
- [ ] Control hints
