A console Tetrisâ„¢-like game written in go.
Kill your time, while you are waiting for a CI to build your branch.
Impress your colleges with your gaming skills during a video call with screen sharing
when you have already fixed a critical production bug, and you still have 10 minutes
for your E2E test to finish before trying to deploy it.
